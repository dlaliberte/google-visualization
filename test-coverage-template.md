## Test Coverage Gaps

### High Priority Gaps

1. **Core Chart Types**: Need to implement tests for all basic chart types
2. **Data Handling**: Need more tests for large datasets and edge cases
3. **Interaction Events**: Need tests for click, selection, and other user interactions

### Medium Priority Gaps

1. **Responsive Behavior**: Need more tests for different viewport sizes
2. **Accessibility**: Need comprehensive accessibility testing
3. **Performance**: Need tests for rendering performance with large datasets

### Low Priority Gaps

1. **Edge Cases**: Need tests for unusual configurations
2. **Browser Compatibility**: Need tests across different browsers
3. **Mobile Interactions**: Need tests for touch events and mobile-specific behaviors

## Test Improvement Plan

### Short-term (1-2 weeks)

1. Implement unit tests for all core chart types
2. Add basic end-to-end tests for remaining chart types
3. Improve test coverage for data handling components

### Medium-term (2-4 weeks)

1. Implement interaction tests for all chart types
2. Add accessibility tests for all components
3. Implement performance tests for critical components

### Long-term (1-2 months)

1. Achieve >80% code coverage across all modules
2. Implement comprehensive visual regression testing
3. Add browser compatibility tests
4. Implement mobile-specific tests
