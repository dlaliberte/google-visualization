/**
 * Calculates a path parallel to a given one at a given distance from it.
 * If the distance is positive, then the parallel path is always to the
 * right of the original path. If negative, it is always to its left.
 * Thus, if the points of your path are ordered clockwise, specify a
 * positive distance to get an internal parallel path, and a negative
 * distance get an external one. If your points are ordered anti-clockwise, the
 * exact opposite applies.
 * The algorithm works as following: for every two adjacent segments, we
 * calculate the parallel segments. If these intersect, we add them to the
 * parallel path with the intersection point as a new path vertex. Otherwise,
 * we add the parallel segments as is and connect them with an arc.
 * @param path The original path.
 * @param dist The requested distance between the original path and
 *     the parallel path.
 * @return The parallel path, or an empty path if
 *     the original one has less than 2 segments.
