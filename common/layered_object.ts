/**
 * @fileoverview A utility class for an object consisting of several layers,
 * where every layer can add new properties to the object or override
 * properties defined by previous layers.
 * The "compact" method returns a compact representation of the object, where
 * every property has its latest value (values which have been overridden do
 * not appear in this representation). For example, [{a:5, b:3}, {a:666}] is
 * compacted into {a:666, b:3}.
 *
 * Several notes:
 * - Properties introduced in higher levels will be added to the compact
 *   object. For example, [{a:666}, {a:5, b:3}] is merged into {a:5, b:3}. This
 *   semantics is consistent with overriding the "undefined" value these
 *   properties had in lower levels.
 * - Sub-objects are considered leafs in the following cases:
 *   1) Non objects (e.g., primitives).
 *   2) Arrays - There is no simple option to override a value at a specific
 *      index.
 *   3) Clone-able class objects (which implement the clone() method).
 *   4) Dates - (Object for which isDateLike() returns true).
 *   Leaf objects may be replaced altogether by a layer, however, their
 *   fields are not subject to a specific override.
 * - Overriding layers cannot delete properties. The user may get a similar
 *   behavior by assigning some special value (e.g., null) to the erased
 *   properties and act accordingly.
 * - Overriding layer may not change the type of an object. One can override
 *   an object with a null value and vice versa, but not, for example,
 *   override a number with a string.
 * - Note: do not use self-referencing objects in the layers. That may cause
 *   a non terminating computation.
