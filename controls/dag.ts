/**
 * A general purpose Direct Acyclic Graph datastructure.
 *
 * Adding and removing edges is O(1). Isolated vertices are not allowed,
 * although forests of graphs are supported. The isValid() method exists
 * to check whether any cycles were introduced while adding edges.
 *
 * There can only be at most one edge connecting any 2 distinct nodes.
 *
 * Any object or primitive type can be used to represent a graph vertex (node).
 *
 * The graph is internally stored as a collection of nodes and a collection
 * of directed edges.
 *
 * A topologicalSort() method is offered to linearize the graph into a sorted
 * list that respects the node dependencies.
 *
 * The other methods signature loosely matches the conventions of structs
 * utility methods (getCount, getValues, ...).
 *
 * WARNING: Any Object that is added to DAG will be modified!
 * Because goog.getUid() is used to identify objects, every object in the dag
 * will be mutated by the addition of a property that uniquely identifies it
 * (@see goog.getUid).
