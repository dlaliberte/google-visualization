/**
 * Base class for Controls user interfaces. Controls' user interfaces behave
 * similarly to visualizations:
 * - They render within a specified container.
 *
 * - Their contents are defined by a State object (equivalent in role to what
 *   DataTable is for visualizations): a key-value map that enumerates the
 *   interface data. For example, a DatePicker user interface might hold the
 *   selected date in its State, while a two-thumbs slider might store the
 *   thumbs' locations in it.
 *
 * - Their behavior is customized via configuration options.
 *
 * - They communicate changes to external parties via events.
 *
 * Every user interface implementation declares specific requirements for its
 * state and allowed configuration options (just like visualizations expect
 * their input DataTable to conform to specific requirements), that callers
 * (typically gviz.controls.Control classes) must adhere to.
 *
 * User interfaces that have the same requirements can be seamlessly swapped
 * between each other.
 *
 * Controls' User interfaces follow this simple lifecycle:
 * - after instance creation, draw() is called passing the interface state and
 *   configuration options. The interface draws itself.
 * - Whenever the user interacts with it affecting its state, an 'uichange'
 *   event is fired. The event carries no payload.
 * - Listeners to 'uichange' events can query the user interface current state
 *   via its getState() method.
 * - When the user interface is no longer used, it should be disposed via its
 *   dispose() method.
