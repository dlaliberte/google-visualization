# Google Visualization API Documentation

Welcome to the official documentation for the Google Visualization API. This site provides guides, tutorials, and a comprehensive API reference to help you create rich, interactive charts and data tools.

The Google Visualization API is a powerful and easy-to-use JavaScript library for creating charts from your data. From simple line charts to complex hierarchical treemaps, the library provides a wide range of chart types for your data visualization needs.

## Where to Start?

- If you are new here, we recommend starting with the **[Getting Started](./getting-started)** guide to create your first chart in minutes.
- To understand the core concepts, check out the guides on **[DataTable and DataView](./datatable)**.
- For a complete list of all available charts and their options, browse the **[Chart Gallery](./chart-gallery)**.

## Documentation Plan

This documentation is a work in progress. We are actively working on documenting the entire public API. You can view our progress and the overall structure in the **[Documentation Plan](./documentation-plan)**.

We welcome your feedback and contributions to make this documentation better!

## Project Modernization

This library has recently undergone a significant modernization effort to replace the legacy Google Closure Library with modern TypeScript and standard JavaScript modules. This migration is now **99% complete**, resulting in a more maintainable, type-safe, and future-proof codebase.

This effort makes it easier for new developers to contribute and ensures the long-term health of the Google Visualization API.

You can read more about the successful migration in the **[Project Modernization](./development-modernization)** page.
