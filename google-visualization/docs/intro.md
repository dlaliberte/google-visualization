# Google Visualization API Documentation

Welcome to the official documentation for the Google Visualization API. This site provides guides, tutorials, and a comprehensive API reference to help you create rich, interactive charts and data tools.

The Google Visualization API is a powerful and easy-to-use JavaScript library for creating charts from your data. From simple line charts to complex hierarchical treemaps, the library provides a wide range of chart types for your data visualization needs.

## Where to Start?

- If you are new here, we recommend starting with the **[Getting Started](./getting-started)** guide to create your first chart in minutes.
- For those who want to dive deeper into specific aspects of the API, check out the **[API Reference](./api-reference)** section.
- To explore advanced topics like customizing chart behavior or integrating with other libraries, refer to the **[Advanced Topics](./advanced-topics)** section.
- Looking for examples? Check out the **[Examples](./examples)** section where you'll find ready-made demos that showcase various features of the API.
- Need support? Visit our **[Support Page](https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/support)** for resources such as FAQs, troubleshooting tips, and community forums.

## Documentation Plan

This documentation is a work in progress. We are actively working on documenting the entire public API. You can view our progress and the overall structure in the **Documentation Plan**.

We welcome your feedback and contributions to make this documentation better!

## Project Modernization

This library has recently undergone a significant modernization effort to replace the legacy Google Closure Library with modern TypeScript and standard JavaScript modules. This migration is now **99% complete**, resulting in a more maintainable, type-safe, and future-proof codebase.

This effort makes it easier for new developers to contribute and ensures the long-term health of the Google Visualization API.

You can read more about the successful migration in the **[Project Modernization](./development-modernization)** page.
