# Trendlines Directory

This directory contains the modules responsible for calculating and defining various types of trendlines (e.g., linear, exponential, polynomial) that can be overlaid on charts.

## Core Functionality

*   **`trendlines.ts`**:
    *   Defines the `TrendlineType` enum (`LINEAR`, `EXPONENTIAL`, `POLYNOMIAL`).
    *   `TRENDLINE_TYPE_TO_FUNCTION`: A map that associates each `TrendlineType` with its corresponding calculation function.
*   **`linear_regression.ts`**:
    *   `linearRegression(...)`: Calculates the coefficients (slope and intercept) and R-squared value for a simple linear regression (y = mx + c) based on a given dataset. It essentially finds the line of best fit. This function is a specialized case of polynomial regression (degree 1).
*   **`polynomial_trendline_definer.ts`**:
    *   `PolynomialTrendlineDefiner`: A class used to calculate polynomial trendlines of a specified degree.
        *   It takes data points (`add(x, y)`) and uses matrix operations (solving a system of linear equations via Gaussian elimination/reduced row echelon form, likely using `goog.math.Matrix`) to find the polynomial coefficients that best fit the data.
        *   `getTrendline()`: Returns an object containing the calculated `coefficients`, the R-squared value (`r2`), the generated trendline `data` points for plotting, and an `equation` object representing the polynomial.
    *   `TrendlineEquation`: An interface defining the structure returned by `getTrendline()`.
*   **`linear_trendline.ts`**:
    *   `linearTrendline(...)`: A convenience function that uses `linearRegression` to compute a linear trendline. It then formats the result, including creating a mathematical `Expression` object (from `math/expression/`) representing the line equation (y = mx + b).
*   **`exponential_trendline.ts`**:
    *   `exponentialTrendline(...)`: Calculates an exponential trendline (y = a * e^(bx)). It achieves this by transforming the y-values to log(y), performing a linear regression on (x, log(y)), and then transforming the resulting linear equation back into an exponential form. It also constructs the corresponding `Expression` object.
*   **`polynomial_trendline.ts`**:
    *   `polynomialTrendline(...)`: A function that uses `PolynomialTrendlineDefiner` to compute a polynomial trendline of a given degree. It also constructs the `Expression` object for the polynomial equation.
*   **`data_builder.ts`**:
    *   `DataBuilder`: A class used to generate a series of (x, y) data points for plotting a calculated trendline. It takes a function (`yFunction`) that calculates y for a given x, and a `maxgap` parameter. If the gap between consecutive x-values in the input data (or specified range) is too large, it inserts intermediate points to ensure the trendline appears smooth when rendered.
*   **`linear_data_builder.ts`**:
    *   `LinearDataBuilder`: A subclass of `DataBuilder` specifically for linear trendlines, where `yFunction` is simply `offset + slope * x`.

## How It Works (Simplified Flow)

1.  A chart (e.g., ScatterChart) is configured to display a trendline of a certain `TrendlineType` (e.g., 'linear', 'polynomial') for a specific series.
2.  The chart's drawing logic identifies the relevant data points (x, y values) for that series.
3.  The appropriate function from `trendlines.ts` (e.g., `linearTrendline` or `polynomialTrendline`) is called with the data points and trendline options (like degree for polynomial).
4.  **Calculation**:
    *   For linear/polynomial: `PolynomialTrendlineDefiner` sets up and solves a system of linear equations to find the best-fit coefficients.
    *   For exponential: Data is transformed (y -> log(y)), linear regression is performed, and results are transformed back.
5.  The R-squared value is calculated to indicate the goodness of fit.
6.  **Data Generation for Plotting**: A `DataBuilder` (or `LinearDataBuilder`) instance is created using the calculated trendline equation (coefficients).
7.  The `DataBuilder` is fed with the x-values from the original data or a specified range. It calculates the corresponding y-values using the trendline equation and inserts intermediate points if `maxGap` is exceeded, producing an array of `[x, y]` points.
8.  **Equation Object**: An `Expression` object representing the trendline's mathematical formula is constructed using classes from the `math/expression/` directory.
9.  The chart renderer then uses the generated `[x, y]` data points to draw the trendline curve and may use the `Expression` object to display the equation on the chart.

## Relationships to Other Parts of the Code

*   **`visualization/corechart/`**:
    *   Charts like `ScatterChart`, `LineChart`, and `ColumnChart` are the primary consumers of this directory. They use the trendline functions to calculate and obtain data for rendering trendlines based on user options (`trendlines` option).
    *   The `ChartDefinition` might store trendline data or references to trendline objects.
*   **`math/expression/`**: The trendline functions in this directory construct `Expression` objects (e.g., `Add`, `Mul`, `Pow`, `GVizNumber`, `Variable`) to represent the mathematical equations of the trendlines. This allows for potential symbolic manipulation or string rendering of the equations.
*   **`common/number_scale_util.ts`**: The `domainScale` option, if provided to trendline functions, uses `Converter` objects from this module to handle data transformations (e.g., for log scales on the domain axis) before regression calculations.
*   **`graphics/`**: The `[x,y]` data points generated by `DataBuilder` are ultimately used by a graphics renderer (e.g., to draw a line or curve path) to visually represent the trendline on the chart.

This directory provides the analytical engine for fitting various mathematical models to chart data, enabling visualizations to display underlying trends.The `README.md` for the `trendlines` directory has been created.

Next, I'll analyze the `visualization` directory. This is a large one, so I'll start with its top-level files and then address subdirectories if the plan step isn't marked complete.
