# Axis Tests Directory

This directory contains unit tests for the axis-related functionalities found in the parent `axis` directory. Each test file generally corresponds to a specific `.ts` file in the `axis` directory, ensuring that individual components and utilities are working as expected.

## Purpose of Tests

The tests in this directory aim to:

*   **Verify Correctness:** Ensure that axis calculations, such as tick positioning, label generation, and data-to-screen mapping, are accurate under various conditions.
*   **Test Edge Cases:** Cover scenarios like empty data, single data points, reversed axes, logarithmic scales, and different time granularities.
*   **Prevent Regressions:** Act as a safety net to catch any unintended changes or bugs introduced during code modifications.
*   **Validate Mappers:** Confirm that linear, logarithmic, and other mappers correctly transform values between data and screen coordinates.
*   **Check Sequence Generation:** Ensure that different sequence generators (linear, powers of 10, time-based) produce the correct series of values.
*   **Test Decoration Suppliers:** Verify that axis decoration suppliers (for linear, log, and time axes) create the appropriate visual elements (lines, ticks, labels).
*   **Validate Text Handling:** Test text measurement, label collision detection, and tick dilution logic.
*   **Ensure Utility Functions Work:** Confirm that helper functions in `axis/utils.ts` and other utility files perform their tasks correctly.

## Relationship to Other Parts of the Code

*   **`axis/` (Parent Directory):** This directory directly tests the code within the parent `axis` directory. Each `*_test.ts` file here typically imports and tests the corresponding `*.ts` file from `axis/`.
*   **`@npm//@closure/testing/`:** The tests heavily rely on the Closure testing framework (`asserts`, `testSuite`) for assertions and test organization.
*   **`common/` and `format/`:** Some tests might indirectly involve utilities from these directories if the axis components being tested use them (e.g., for options handling or number/date formatting during label generation).

The tests are crucial for maintaining the stability and correctness of the axis rendering logic, which is a fundamental part of the charting library.The `README.md` for `axis/tests` has been created.

Next, I'll analyze the `axis/value_scale` directory.
